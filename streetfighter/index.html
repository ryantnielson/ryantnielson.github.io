      <h1>A Greater International Presence Lowers the Chances For the US to Win EVO</h1>
      <p>With Street Fighter 5 coming out in spring 2016 this could be the last time the US could to win  Ultra Street Fighter 4 at EVO. But looking at past performances it is unlikely to happen.</p>

      <p>The Evolution Championship Series, or EVO, is the defacto world championship tournament of fighting games. It started as Battle by the Bay in California in 1996 and now it's the largest open fighting game tournament. People travel to Las Vegas to see who is the best in the world.  It contiues to grow each year since 2009 when Street Fighter 4 was released. </p>
      <p>The competitive fighting game scene was staring to dwindle becasue of lack of new games being released. When Street Fighter 4 came out it rejuvinated fighting games in gerenal but the competitive scene as well.</p>
      
    <p>The Street Fighter series has been the headline game for EVO since its inception in 2002. It is the game that brigning people from all over the world to compete to see who is the best.  For Americans it has been tough to make it to the top.</p>
      <p>It has been this way for a long time.  American players have always had a hard time dealing with foreign players especially players from Japan. This was shown when at EVO 2005 there was a US vs. Japan 5 on 5 exhibition. The US thought that it would be close but Japan won 20-5.

    <p>There has always been a fued in the fighting game community between the world and the US has been around for a long time.  The game that they domanate the US over is Street Fighter 4.</p>
      <p>In 2009 the finals of the tournament was Diago Umehara playing against Justin Wong. It was close but in the end Diago won.  The next year it was Ricky Ortiz but she lost to Daigo as well. Second place is the highest an American would place in Street Fighter 4.</p>
      <p>Last year, French player Oliver "Luffy" Hay won the tournament. It was surprisng because of how the European fight game scene was viewed.  It was also the first time a non-Asian country won EVO. It was surprising becasue some thought that European player weren't on par with the rest of the world.</p>

      <p>With more and more place from all over the world competing at EVO placing at top 8 has been increasingly difficult for the US.  The comppetion coming form other countries that no one knows about has caught players off gaurd.</p>
      <p>Evo has been steadily increasing in competitors since 2009 and has spiked when Street Fighter 4 was updated and the inclusion of other fighting games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee. With the Capcom Pro Tour going on, Capcom has been providing money for the torunament and has caused more players to come out and try to win.</p>
      <p>With more international player coming to compete it has been difficult for US playr to compete but that doesn't that they can't. It could be possibly be the year that someone wins it for America but that player deffinetly has a big hill to climb.  </p>
